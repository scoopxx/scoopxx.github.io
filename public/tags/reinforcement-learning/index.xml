      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intuition&#34;&gt;Intuition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having interests in Reinforcement Learning(RL) for a while, especially after ChatGPT when everyone was talking about &lt;code&gt;RLHF&lt;/code&gt;, but often felt it&amp;rsquo;s too daunting for me to do some reading and dig into it. Recently I finally found some spare time to go through it, and fortunately the famous Richard Sutton&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lt;Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction&amp;gt; book is surprisingly intuitive even for RL beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the mathematical notions used in RL is quite different from those used in supervised learning, and may felt weird or confusing for beginners just like me. As a reference, I will share and summarize my reading notes here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
