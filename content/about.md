Hi, welcome to my personal blog!

My name is Hao, but I go by `hxx` online. I am a Software Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer by profession, with a broad curiosity about everythingâ€”from technical topics like LLM and MLSys to non-technical ones like economics and general science.

I started this blog in 2025, inspired by Paul Graham's ["Writes and Write-Nots"](https://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html) article and Lilian Weng's [blog](https://lilianweng.github.io/). Here, I'll document what I learn, primarily about ML/LLM, and occasionally share thoughts from non-fiction reading as well.
